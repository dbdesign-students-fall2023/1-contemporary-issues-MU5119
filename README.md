# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss two articles about multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI database, e.g., Chat GPT, for research, practice and policy. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In [Opinion Paper: “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223000233), the authors mention that although Generative AI could elevate customer experience and enhance productivity, it may also lead to out of date training data and lack of transparency and credibility, making Chat GPT a not ideal database.

I resonate with the takeaways this passage follows, as one crucial aspect of database is to be synchronous, which turns out Chat GPT doesn't fits in since its latest knowledge was in September 2021.

## Article 2
In [Pros Of ChatGPT For Customer Experience](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2023/04/26/pros-of-chatgpt-for-customer-experience/?sh=54e9af08513f), the author Blake Morgan puts forward that ChatGPT plays a pivotal role for transforming chatbots, in which 80% of consumers say interacting with a chatbot makes them more frustrated.

The point Blake makes is correct in such a way that ChatGPT understands natural language. It has the power to create chatbots and tools that deliver automated and provide frictionless experiences at scale without sacrificing results. However, as mentioned by the first article, the learning-by-doing needs to be updated so to tailor everyone's needs.
