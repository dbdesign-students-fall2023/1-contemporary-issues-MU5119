# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss two articles about multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI database, e.g., ChatGPT, for research, practice and policy. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In [Opinion Paper: “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223000233), the authors mention that although Generative AI could elevate customer experience and enhance productivity, it may also lead to out of date training data and lack of transparency and credibility, making ChatGPT a not ideal database.

I resonate with the takeaways this passage follows, as one crucial aspect of database is to be synchronous, which turns out ChatGPT doesn't fits in since its latest knowledge was in September 2021. Synchronous databases ensure that the data is always up-to-date and consistent with the latest changes. In the context of ChatGPT, this means that it should strive to provide information that is as current as possible.                                                                   
To maintain credibility, it's essential for AI models like ChatGPT to continuously improve and update their knowledge. This ensures that users can rely on the information they receive, making the AI a valuable and trustworthy resource.

## Article 2
In [Pros Of ChatGPT For Customer Experience](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2023/04/26/pros-of-chatgpt-for-customer-experience/?sh=54e9af08513f), the author Blake Morgan puts forward that ChatGPT plays a pivotal role for transforming chatbots, in which 80% of consumers say interacting with a chatbot makes them more frustrated.

The point Blake makes is correct in such a way that ChatGPT understands natural language. It has the power to create chatbots and tools that deliver automated and provide frictionless experiences at scale without sacrificing results. Its strength lies in its ability to understand and generate human-like text. It can comprehend context, answer questions, generate content, and engage in conversations that mimic human interaction.                                      
Nevertheless, while AI models like ChatGPT have a broad understanding of language, they may not always provide tailored solutions for each individual's specific needs. Therefore, as mentioned by the first article, the learning-by-doing needs to be updated as a timely basis.
